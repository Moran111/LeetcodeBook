# 1152. Analyze User Website Visit Pattern



You are given two string arrays `username` and `website` and an integer array `timestamp`. All the given arrays are of the same length and the tuple `[username[i], website[i], timestamp[i]]` indicates that the user `username[i]` visited the website `website[i]` at time `timestamp[i]`.

A **pattern** is a list of three websites (not necessarily distinct).

* For example, `["home", "away", "love"]`, `["leetcode", "love", "leetcode"]`, and `["luffy", "luffy", "luffy"]` are all patterns.

The **score** of a **pattern** is the number of users that visited all the websites in the pattern in the same order they appeared in the pattern.

* For example, if the pattern is `["home", "away", "love"]`, the score is the number of users `x` such that `x` visited `"home"` then visited `"away"` and visited `"love"` after that.
* Similarly, if the pattern is `["leetcode", "love", "leetcode"]`, the score is the number of users `x` such that `x` visited `"leetcode"` then visited `"love"` and visited `"leetcode"` **one more time** after that.
* Also, if the pattern is `["luffy", "luffy", "luffy"]`, the score is the number of users `x` such that `x` visited `"luffy"` three different times at different timestamps.

Return _the **pattern** with the largest **score**_. If there is more than one pattern with the same largest score, return the lexicographically smallest such pattern.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: username = ["joe","joe","joe","james","james","james","james","mary","mary","mary"], timestamp = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], website = ["home","about","career","home","cart","maps","home","home","about","career"]
Output: ["home","about","career"]
Explanation: The tuples in this example are:
["joe","home",1],["joe","about",2],["joe","career",3],["james","home",4],["james","cart",5],["james","maps",6],["james","home",7],["mary","home",8],["mary","about",9], and ["mary","career",10].
The pattern ("home", "about", "career") has score 2 (joe and mary).
The pattern ("home", "cart", "maps") has score 1 (james).
The pattern ("home", "cart", "home") has score 1 (james).
The pattern ("home", "maps", "home") has score 1 (james).
The pattern ("cart", "maps", "home") has score 1 (james).
The pattern ("home", "home", "home") has score 0 (no user visited home 3 times).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: username = ["ua","ua","ua","ub","ub","ub"], timestamp = [1,2,3,4,5,6], website = ["a","b","a","a","b","c"]
Output: ["a","b","a"]
```

**Constraints:**

* `3 <= username.length <= 50`
* `1 <= username[i].length <= 10`
* `timestamp.length == username.length`
* `1 <= timestamp[i] <= 109`
* `website.length == username.length`
* `1 <= website[i].length <= 10`
* `username[i]` and `website[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.
* It is guaranteed that there is at least one user who visited at least three websites.
* All the tuples `[username[i], timestamp[i], website[i]]` are **unique**.



1. Sort all the entries using their timestamp as we need to consider that as well.
2. Now create a list of websites visited by particular User ( added based on timestamp order as all entries sorted in first step)
3. Now generate 3 websites sequence for that user and generate a set to we can avoid duplicate sequence.
4. Now calculate the frequencey of each sequence
5. Get the most used sequence

```

    static class Visit{
        String userName;
        int timestamp;

        }
        return res;

    // It will not return duplicate seq for each user that why we are using Set
