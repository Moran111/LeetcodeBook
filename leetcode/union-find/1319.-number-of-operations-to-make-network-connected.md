# 1319. Number of Operations to Make Network Connected



There are `n` computers numbered from `0` to `n - 1` connected by ethernet cables `connections` forming a network where `connections[i] = [ai, bi]` represents a connection between computers `ai` and `bi`. Any computer can reach any other computer directly or indirectly through the network.

You are given an initial computer network `connections`. You can extract certain cables between two directly connected computers, and place them between any pair of disconnected computers to make them directly connected.

Return _the minimum number of times you need to do this in order to make all the computers connected_. If it is not possible, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/02/sample\_1\_1677.png)

```
Input: n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Remove cable between computer 1 and 2 and place between computers 1 and 3.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/02/sample\_2\_1677.png)

```
Input: n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]
Output: 2
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,2]]
Output: -1
Explanation: There are not enough cables.
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 105`
* `1 <= connections.length <= min(n * (n - 1) / 2, 105)`
* `connections[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= ai, bi < n`
* `ai != bi`
* There are no repeated connections.
* No two computers are connected by more than one cable.

find # of components, also need to know how many edges we can remove (used to reconnect later) - If they have same parent, we have one more extra cable. Then compare it with the # of components to check if we have enough cables.

```

    public int makeConnected(int n, int[][] connections) {
        int[] parent = new int[n];

        }
        // availbe edge to connect nodes
        int extraEdge = 0;
        int numOfComponent = n;
        for (int[] c: connections) {
            int x = c[0];
            int y = c[1];
            int px = find(x, parent);
            int py = find(y, parent);
            if (px != py) {
                parent[px] = py;
                numOfComponent--;
            } else {
                extraEdge++;
            }
        }
        
        if (extraEdge < numOfComponent - 1) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        return numOfComponent - 1;
    }

        if (parent[x] == x) {
            return x;
        }
        parent[x] = find(parent[x], parent);
        return parent[x];
    }
