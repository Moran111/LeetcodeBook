# 742. Closest Leaf in a Binary Tree



Given the `root` of a binary tree where every node has **a unique value** and a target integer `k`, return _the value of the **nearest leaf node** to the target_ `k` _in the tree_.

**Nearest to a leaf** means the least number of edges traveled on the binary tree to reach any leaf of the tree. Also, a node is called a leaf if it has no children.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/13/closest1-tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,3,2], k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: Either 2 or 3 is the nearest leaf node to the target of 1.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/13/closest2-tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1], k = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The nearest leaf node is the root node itself.
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/13/closest3-tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,null,null,null,5,null,6], k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: The leaf node with value 3 (and not the leaf node with value 6) is nearest to the node with value 2.
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
* `1 <= Node.val <= 1000`
* All the values of the tree are **unique**.
* There exist some node in the tree where `Node.val == k`.

think about where are the answers may come from. 1. it may come from its own subtree. 2. it may come from the right subtree of its ancester. (check example 3). **Lowest Height means**, take example 3, Root node. lowest height is node 3 (height is 1).

if it comes from subtree, we need to get the lowest height node for each node. If the node is target node, we can update its one possible result. And calculate 2.&#x20;

For calculate 2, we need to know the distance between root to the target and lowest heigth node of its root.&#x20;

then, think about how can we put these info in one recursion ????

```
class ResultType {
    int lowestHeight; // lowest height of this root
    TreeNode leaf;  // lowest height's leaf
    int distance;  // distance between root and target
    public ResultType(int l, TreeNode node, int dis) {
        this.lowestHeight = l;
        this.leaf = node;
        this.distance = dis;
    }
}
```

When we want to get the distance between root and target, we want left subtree return sth and right subtree return sth. if left subtree or right subtree contian target, we return curr depth + 1.&#x20;

```
int disRootToTarget = -1;
        if (root.val == k) {
            disRootToTarget = 0;
        } else if (left.distance == -1 && right.distance == -1) {
            // target not in the left subtree and also not in the right subtree
            disRootToTarget = -1;
        } else if (left.distance != -1) {
            // target in the right subtree but not in left subtree
            disRootToTarget = left.distance + 1;
        } else {
            // target in left subtree but not right
            disRootToTarget = right.distance + 1;
        }
        
```

We need to update global variable when the root is leaf and it is target. (leaf node is target)

```
class Solution {
    TreeNode shortestLeaf;
    int shortestDistance = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    
    public int findClosestLeaf(TreeNode root, int k) {
        if (root.left == null && root.right == null) {
            return root.val;
        }
        helper(root, k);
        return shortestLeaf.val;
    }
    
    // lowest height (nearest height) of each root dis
    // return the leaf of the lowest height
    // find root to target 
    private ResultType helper(TreeNode root, int k) {
        if (root == null) {
            return new ResultType(Integer.MAX_VALUE, root, -2);
        }
        if (root.left == null && root.right == null) {
            if (root.val == k) {
                // update the global variable
                shortestLeaf = root;
                shortestDistance = 0;
                return new ResultType(0, root, 0);
            } else {
                 return new ResultType(0, root, -1);
            }
        }
        
        ResultType left = helper(root.left, k);
        ResultType right = helper(root.right, k);
        
        // leaf with lowest height
        TreeNode lowestHeightLeaf = root;
        if (left.lowestHeight > right.lowestHeight) {
            lowestHeightLeaf = right.leaf;
        } else {
            lowestHeightLeaf = left.leaf;
        }
        
        int lowestHeight = Math.min(left.lowestHeight, right.lowestHeight) + 1;
        
        int disRootToTarget = -1;
        if (root.val == k) {
            disRootToTarget = 0;
        } else if (left.distance == -1 && right.distance == -1) {
            // target not in the left subtree and also not in the right subtree
            disRootToTarget = -1;
        } else if (left.distance != -1) {
            // target in the right subtree but not in left subtree
            disRootToTarget = left.distance + 1;
        } else {
            // target in left subtree but not right
            disRootToTarget = right.distance + 1;
        }
        
        if (root.val == k && lowestHeight < shortestDistance) {
            shortestLeaf = lowestHeightLeaf;
            shortestDistance = lowestHeight;
        } 
        // target exist
        if (disRootToTarget != -1 && lowestHeight + disRootToTarget < shortestDistance) {
            shortestLeaf = lowestHeightLeaf;
            shortestDistance = lowestHeight + disRootToTarget;
        }
        
        return new ResultType(lowestHeight, lowestHeightLeaf, disRootToTarget);
    }
}

class ResultType {
    int lowestHeight; // lowest height of this root
    TreeNode leaf;  // lowest height's leaf
    int distance;  // distance between root and target
    public ResultType(int l, TreeNode node, int dis) {
        this.lowestHeight = l;
        this.leaf = node;
        this.distance = dis;
    }
}
```
