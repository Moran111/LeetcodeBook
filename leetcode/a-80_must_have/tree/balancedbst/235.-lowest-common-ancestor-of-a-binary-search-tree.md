# 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree



Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest\_common\_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q`as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarysearchtree\_improved.png)

```
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarysearchtree\_improved.png)

```
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
Output: 2
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 105]`.
* `-109 <= Node.val <= 109`
* All `Node.val` are **unique**.
* `p != q`
* `p` and `q` will exist in the BST.

## what is a binary search tree?&#x20;

root is null?  duplicate exist in the Tree? is P and Q both exist in the Tree?&#x20;

## Solution

because it is a bineary search tree.&#x20;

When p and q in the one side, if root == p or root == q, we can say the p is the ancestor or q is the ancestor. eg: p and q are in the left side of root, if p is root, then q will be less than p -> p is q's lowest ancestor

&#x20;   p (root)

q

When p and q in the seperate side of the root, then root will be the lowest common ancester.&#x20;

Time complexity is : O(height) -> special example: linked list (so it is height) we only need to go one side of the tree.&#x20;

```
class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if (root == null) {
            return null;
        }
        
        if (root == p || root == q) {
            return root;
        }
        
        // if root.val in the middle of p.val and q.val
        // then root must be their LCA -> specific for bst
        // for bst, if root == p or root == q, p or q will be our final result
        // because in this case, both p and q in left subtree 
        // or both p and q in the right subtree 
        
        // for binary tree, we need to continue to find until we find p or q
        if (p.val < root.val && q.val < root.val) {
            return lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
        } else if (p.val > root.val && q.val > root.val) {
            return lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
        } else {
            return root;
        }
    }
}
// time complexity: O(height) -> linked list 
```
