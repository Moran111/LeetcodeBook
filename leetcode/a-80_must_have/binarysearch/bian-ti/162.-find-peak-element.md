# 162. Find Peak Element

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given an integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to **any of the peaks**.

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞`.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
* `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
* `nums[i] != nums[i + 1]` for all valid `i`.

We can view any given sequence in nums array as **alternating ascending and descending sequences**. By making use of this, and the fact that we can return any peak as the result, we can make use of Binary Search to find the required peak element.

In case of simple Binary Search, we work on a sorted sequence of numbers and try to find out the required number by reducing the search space at every step. In this case, we use a modification of this simple Binary Search to our advantage.

In this question, we start at mid. **If this element happens to be lying in a descend**ing sequence of numbers. or a local falling slope(found by comparing n u m s \[ i ] nums\[i] to its right neighbour), **it means that the peak will always lie towards the left of this element**. Thus, we reduce the search space to the left of m i d mid(including itself) and perform the same process on left subarray.

```
public class Solution {
    /**
     * @param A: An integers array.
     * @return: return any of peek positions.
     */
    public int findPeak(int[] nums) {
        // write your code here
        int left = 0; int right = nums.length - 1;
        while (left + 1 < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            // if mid in desending order part, mid - 1 > mid > mid + 1
            if (nums[mid - 1] > nums[mid] && nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]) {
                right = mid;
            } else if (nums[mid - 1] < nums[mid] && nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]) {
                return mid;
            } else {
                left = mid;
            }
        }
        
        if (nums[left] < nums[right]) {
            return right;
        } 
        return left;
    }
}
```
