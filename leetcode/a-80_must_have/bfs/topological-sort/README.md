# Topological Sort

**Topological sort** _**gives a linear ordering of vertices in a directed acyclic graph such that, for every directed edge a -> b, vertex ‘a’ comes before vertex ‘b’.**_&#x20;

Remember, a directed acyclic graph has at least one vertex with an in-degree of 0 and one vertex with an out-degree of 0.

There can be more than one topological ordering for a directed acyclic graph.
