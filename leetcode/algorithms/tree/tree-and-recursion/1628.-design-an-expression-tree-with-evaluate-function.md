# 1628. Design an Expression Tree With Evaluate Function



Given the `postfix` tokens of an arithmetic expression, build and return _the binary expression tree that represents this expression._

**Postfix** notation is a notation for writing arithmetic expressions in which the operands (numbers) appear before their operators. For example, the postfix tokens of the expression `4*(5-(7+2))` are represented in the array `postfix = ["4","5","7","2","+","-","*"]`.

The class `Node` is an interface you should use to implement the binary expression tree. The returned tree will be tested using the `evaluate` function, which is supposed to evaluate the tree's value. You should not remove the `Node` class; however, you can modify it as you wish, and you can define other classes to implement it if needed.

A [**binary expression tree**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary\_expression\_tree) is a kind of binary tree used to represent arithmetic expressions. Each node of a binary expression tree has either zero or two children. Leaf nodes (nodes with 0 children) correspond to operands (numbers), and internal nodes (nodes with two children) correspond to the operators `'+'` (addition), `'-'` (subtraction), `'*'` (multiplication), and `'/'` (division).

It's guaranteed that no subtree will yield a value that exceeds `109` in absolute value, and all the operations are valid (i.e., no division by zero).

**Follow up:** Could you design the expression tree such that it is more modular? For example, is your design able to support additional operators without making changes to your existing `evaluate` implementation?

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/15/untitled-diagram.png)

```
Input: s = ["3","4","+","2","*","7","/"]
Output: 2
Explanation: this expression evaluates to the above binary tree with expression ((3+4)*2)/7) = 14/7 = 2.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/15/untitled-diagram2.png)

```
Input: s = ["4","5","2","7","+","-","*"]
Output: -16
Explanation: this expression evaluates to the above binary tree with expression 4*(5-(2+7)) = 4*(-4) = -16.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = ["4","2","+","3","5","1","-","*","+"]
Output: 18
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: s = ["100","200","+","2","/","5","*","7","+"]
Output: 757
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length < 100`
* `s.length` is odd.
* `s` consists of numbers and the characters `'+'`, `'-'`, `'*'`, and `'/'`.
* If `s[i]` is a number, its integer representation is no more than `105`.
* It is guaranteed that `s` is a valid expression.
* The absolute value of the result and intermediate values will not exceed `109`.
* It is guaranteed that no expression will include division by zero.

## Solution 1: No design pattern applied&#x20;

Abstract method cannot have body. Using Stack to build tree. No Design Pattern

```
/**
 * This is the interface for the expression tree Node.
 * You should not remove it, and you can define some classes to implement it.
 */

abstract class Node { 
    public abstract int evaluate(); // abstract method cannot have body 
    Node left;
    Node right;
    int val;
    String operation; 
};

class TreeNode extends Node {
    
    public TreeNode (int val) {
        this.val = val;
    }
    
    public TreeNode (String operation) {
        this.operation = operation;
    }
    
    // recursion
    public int evaluate() {
        // it is a number
        if (operation == null) {
            return this.val;
        }
        if (operation.equals("+")) {
            return left.evaluate() + right.evaluate();
        } else if (operation.equals("-")) {
            return left.evaluate() - right.evaluate();
        } else if (operation.equals("*")) {
            return left.evaluate() * right.evaluate();
        } else {
            return left.evaluate() / right.evaluate();
        } 
     }
}


/**
 * This is the TreeBuilder class.
 * You can treat it as the driver code that takes the postinfix input 
 * and returns the expression tree represnting it as a Node.
 */

class TreeBuilder {
    Node buildTree(String[] postfix) {
        // in stack  - left right root
        Deque<Node> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
        for (String str: postfix) {
            
            // if it is operation
            if (str.equals("+") || str.equals("-") || str.equals("*") || str.equals("/")) {
                TreeNode node = new TreeNode(str);
                // what is its left node and what its right node
                node.right = stack.pop();
                node.left = stack.pop();
                stack.push(node);
            } else {
                TreeNode node = new TreeNode(Integer.parseInt(str));
                stack.push(node);
            }
        }
        
        return stack.pop();
    }
};


/**
 * Your TreeBuilder object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * TreeBuilder obj = new TreeBuilder();
 * Node expTree = obj.buildTree(postfix);
 * int ans = expTree.evaluate();
 */
```

## Solution 2: follow up

Having a abstract Operator class&#x20;

```
/**
 * This is the interface for the expression tree Node.
 * You should not remove it, and you can define some classes to implement it.
 */

// Could be a number or an operator
abstract class Node {
    public abstract int evaluate();
    // define your fields here
};

// Represents a number 
class Operand extends Node {
    private int val;
    public Operand(int val) {
        this.val = val;
    }
    @Override
    public int evaluate() {
        return val;
    }
}

// Represents an operator
abstract class Operator extends Node {
    public Node left;
    public Node right;
}

// Different operators
class Add extends Operator {
    @Override
    public int evaluate() {
        return left.evaluate() + right.evaluate();
    }
}
class Substract extends Operator {
    @Override
    public int evaluate() {
        return left.evaluate() - right.evaluate();
    }
}
class Multiply extends Operator {
    @Override
    public int evaluate() {
        return left.evaluate() * right.evaluate();
    }
}
class DivideBy extends Operator {
    @Override
    public int evaluate() {
        return left.evaluate() / right.evaluate();
    }
}
