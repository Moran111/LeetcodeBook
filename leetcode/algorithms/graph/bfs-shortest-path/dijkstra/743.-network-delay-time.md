# 743. Network Delay Time

You are given a network of `n` nodes, labeled from `1` to `n`. You are also given `times`, a list of travel times as directed edges `times[i] = (ui, vi, wi)`, where `ui` is the source node, `vi` is the target node, and `wi` is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.

We will send a signal from a given node `k`. Return the time it takes for all the `n` nodes to receive the signal. If it is impossible for all the `n` nodes to receive the signal, return `-1`.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/05/23/931\_example\_1.png)

```
Input: times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], n = 4, k = 2
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 1
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 2
Output: -1
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= k <= n <= 100`
* `1 <= times.length <= 6000`
* `times[i].length == 3`
* `1 <= ui, vi <= n`
* `ui != vi`
* `0 <= wi <= 100`
* All the pairs `(ui, vi)` are **unique**. (i.e., no multiple edges.)

Dijikstra Algorithm:&#x20;

find the shortest path from single source to other nodes

// 1. have a distance map// 2. have a minHeap to store node and sort by edge to source // 3. enqueue source // 4. put node from queue, and put the distance into the distance map // as long as it pulled form queue, the distance will not be changed later, we find the // min distance from source to this node // 5. check all of its neigbours, we update their distance with (min curr dis + weight) if // needed (bzs, we use PR, we can directly added it, we don't need to remove it, the smaller distance will go first automatically) // Dijkstra's algorithm repeatedly making the candidate move that has the least distance travelled.

```

Use Map<Integer, Map<Integer, Integer>> to store the source node,
     target node and the distance between them.
    
Offer the node K to a PriorityQueue.
    
Then keep getting the closest nodes to the current node and calculate 
the distance from the source (K) to this node (absolute distance). 
Use a Map to store the shortest absolute distance of each node.

Return the node with the largest absolute distance.

    public int networkDelayTime(int[][] times, int n, int k) {
        // store node and its finilized distance to source

        //              node, weight

        for (int[] time: times) {
            graph.putIfAbsent(time[0], new ArrayList<>());
            graph.get(time[0]).add(new int[]{time[1], time[2]});
        }
        // pq (node, distance to source)
        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a,b) -> a[1] - b[1]);
        
        pq.offer(new int[]{k, 0});
        
        while(!pq.isEmpty()) {
            int[] curr = pq.poll();
            if (distance.containsKey(curr[0])) {
                continue;
            }
            int currDist = curr[1];
            distance.put(curr[0], curr[1]);
            // curr[1] must be the shortest path from source to curr[0] 
            // -> based on dijasktra assumption
            if (!graph.containsKey(curr[0])) {
                continue;
            }
            // loop all the edge to its neigbour
            List<int[]> nexts = graph.get(curr[0]);
            for (int[] next: nexts) {
                // if the neigbour already in distance 
                // -> already has shortest path to source

                    continue;
                }
                // step 5
                pq.offer(new int[]{next[0], currDist + next[1]});
            }
        }
        
                    
        // didn't find all nodes
        if (distance.size() != n) {
            return -1;
        }

        int ans = 0;
        // the largest path
