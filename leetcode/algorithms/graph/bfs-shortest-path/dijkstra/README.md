# Dijkstra

single source path, given an single source, we can find the shortest path from each node in the graph to this source

undirected and weighted graph&#x20;

distance to calcuate the distance to the source

minHeap: store vertex but sort by distance to the source, each time we meet a vertex, we need to update its distance&#x20;

Assumption: each node we can get from now have the shortest path to source



Time Complexity:&#x20;

Space Complexity:&#x20;
