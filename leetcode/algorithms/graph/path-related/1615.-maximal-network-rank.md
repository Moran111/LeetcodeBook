# 1615. Maximal Network Rank



There is an infrastructure of `n` cities with some number of `roads` connecting these cities. Each `roads[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is a bidirectional road between cities `ai` and `bi`.

The **network rank** of **two different cities** is defined as the total number of **directly** connected roads to **either**city. If a road is directly connected to both cities, it is only counted **once**.

The **maximal network rank** of the infrastructure is the **maximum network rank** of all pairs of different cities.

Given the integer `n` and the array `roads`, return _the **maximal network rank** of the entire infrastructure_.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/21/ex1.png)

```
Input: n = 4, roads = [[0,1],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The network rank of cities 0 and 1 is 4 as there are 4 roads that are connected to either 0 or 1. The road between 0 and 1 is only counted once.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/21/ex2.png)

```
Input: n = 5, roads = [[0,1],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3],[2,3],[2,4]]
Output: 5
Explanation: There are 5 roads that are connected to cities 1 or 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 8, roads = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[2,4],[5,6],[5,7]]
Output: 5
Explanation: The network rank of 2 and 5 is 5. Notice that all the cities do not have to be connected.
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= n <= 100`
* `0 <= roads.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
* `roads[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= ai, bi <= n-1`
* `ai != bi`
* Each pair of cities has **at most one** road connecting them.

For this question, it want us to calcuate the rank for all pair of nodes. If node A and node B are connected, the rank will be only count once.&#x20;

Example 1:&#x20;

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/21/ex1.png)

0: 2   1:3    2:1    3:2   for each edge, we calcualte increase the rank of edge. &#x20;

0-1 0++, 1++

1-2 1++, 2++

0-3 0++, 3++

1-3, 1++, 3++

if 0-1 are directly connected, we need to reduce the total rank (rank 0 + rank 1) by 1.&#x20;

```
class Solution {
    public int maximalNetworkRank(int n, int[][] roads) {
        // loop each edge, find the rank of each node
        
        // also need to know if two node are connected or not
        // if they connected, we need to do rank - 1 finally
        boolean[][] connected = new boolean[n][n];
        // undirected graph
        int[] rank = new int[n];
        for (int[] road: roads) {
            int from = road[0];
            int to = road[1];
            
            rank[from]++;
            rank[to]++;
            connected[from][to] = true;
            connected[to][from] = true; 
        }
        
        // check every node connections here
        //我们遍历一遍roads数组之后，我们可以把edges数组和adj矩阵都统计完毕。
        // 之后我们再用两个for loop遍历这N个点，看看每两个不同的点之间的rank sum。
        // 注意如果两点是能直接相连的，他们在邻接矩阵adj里就会是true，此时rank需要减一。
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                int total = rank[i] + rank[j];
                // for directly connected node i and j, we only count once
                if (connected[i][j]) {
                    total -= 1;
                }
                res = Math.max(res, total);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
