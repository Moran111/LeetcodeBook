# 1268. Search Suggestions System



Given an array of strings `products` and a string `searchWord`. We want to design a system that suggests at most three product names from `products` after each character of `searchWord` is typed. Suggested products should have common prefix with the searchWord. If there are more than three products with a common prefix return the three lexicographically minimums products.

Return _list of lists_ of the suggested `products` after each character of `searchWord` is typed.&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: products = ["mobile","mouse","moneypot","monitor","mousepad"], searchWord = "mouse"
Output: [
["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],
["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],
["mouse","mousepad"],
["mouse","mousepad"],
["mouse","mousepad"]
]
Explanation: products sorted lexicographically = ["mobile","moneypot","monitor","mouse","mousepad"]
After typing m and mo all products match and we show user ["mobile","moneypot","monitor"]
After typing mou, mous and mouse the system suggests ["mouse","mousepad"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: products = ["havana"], searchWord = "havana"
Output: [["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"]]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: products = ["bags","baggage","banner","box","cloths"], searchWord = "bags"
Output: [["baggage","bags","banner"],["baggage","bags","banner"],["baggage","bags"],["bags"]]
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: products = ["havana"], searchWord = "tatiana"
Output: [[],[],[],[],[],[],[]]
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= products.length <= 1000`
* There are no repeated elements in `products`.
* `1 <= Î£ products[i].length <= 2 * 10^4`
* All characters of `products[i]` are lower-case English letters.
* `1 <= searchWord.length <= 1000`
* All characters of `searchWord` are lower-case English letters.

// binary search // because the return list is sorted, so we can sort the products array // sorted array -> binary search // search the first appeared index, and find next three products of it

// for each char in search word find the at most three minimums products

### **Intuition**

In a sorted list of words,\
for any word `A[i]`,\
all its sugested words must following this word in the list.

For example, if `A[i]` is a prefix of `A[j]`,\
A\[i] must be the prefix of `A[i + 1], A[i + 2], ..., A[j]`

### **Explanation**

With this observation,\
we can binary search the position of each prefix of search `word`,\
and check if the next 3 words is a valid suggestion.



```
// only pass 25 cases
class Solution {
    public List<List<String>> suggestedProducts(String[] products, String searchWord) {
        List<List<String>> res = new ArrayList<>();
        Arrays.sort(products);
        
        String prefix = "";
        for (char c: searchWord.toCharArray()) {
            prefix += c;
            int index = binarySearch(products, prefix);
            if (index == -1) {
                res.add(new ArrayList<>());
                continue;
            }
            // System.out.println(index);
            List<String> temp = new ArrayList<>();  
            for (int i = index; i < Math.min(index+3, products.length); i++) {
                if (products[i].indexOf(prefix) != -1) {
                    temp.add(products[i]);
                }
            }
            res.add(temp);
        }
        return res;
    }
    
    // search the first position of prefiix
    private int binarySearch(String[] sortedProducts, String prefix) {
        int l = 0; int r = sortedProducts.length-1;
        while (l + 1 < r) {
            int mid = l + (r - l)/2;   
            // if prefix less than or equal to mid, find l-mid, means prefix < mid
            if (prefix.compareTo(sortedProducts[mid]) <= 0) {
                r = mid;
            } else {
                l = mid;
            }
        }
        
        if (sortedProducts[l].indexOf(prefix) != -1) {
            return l;
        }
        if (sortedProducts[r].indexOf(prefix) != -1) {
            return r;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```
