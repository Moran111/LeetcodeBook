# 547. Number of Provinces



There are `n` cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city `a` is connected directly with city `b`, and city `b` is connected directly with city `c`, then city `a` is connected indirectly with city `c`.

A **province** is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.

You are given an `n x n` matrix `isConnected` where `isConnected[i][j] = 1` if the `ith` city and the `jth` city are directly connected, and `isConnected[i][j] = 0` otherwise.

Return _the total number of **provinces**_.

**Example 1:**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/24/graph1.jpg)

```
Input: isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/24/graph2.jpg)

```
Input: isConnected = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 200`
* `n == isConnected.length`
* `n == isConnected[i].length`
* `isConnected[i][j]` is `1` or `0`.
* `isConnected[i][i] == 1`
* `isConnected[i][j] == isConnected[j][i]`

(i, j) in the grid -> i and j has relationship

(curr, other people) -> curr and other people has relationship

```
class Solution {
    public int findCircleNum(int[][] isConnected) {
        int res = 0;
        int n = isConnected.length; // have n provinces
        // 枚举所有的people，find its friends
        Set<Integer> visited = new HashSet<>(); 
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (visited.contains(i)) {
                continue;
            }
            dfs(isConnected, i, n, visited);
            res++; // check how many people are not been visited by others
        }
        return res;
    }
    
    // curr province
    private void dfs(int[][]isConnected, int curr, int n, Set<Integer> visited) {
        if (visited.contains(curr)) {
            return;
        }
        
        visited.add(curr);
        // loop all friends
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // if curr people and people i have relationship
            // and people i not enroll in other relationship
            if (isConnected[curr][i] == 1 && !visited.contains(i)) {
                dfs(isConnected, i, n, visited);
            } 
        }
    }
