# 1762. Buildings With an Ocean View



There are `n` buildings in a line. You are given an integer array `heights` of size `n` that represents the heights of the buildings in the line.

The ocean is to the right of the buildings. A building has an ocean view if the building can see the ocean without obstructions. Formally, a building has an ocean view if all the buildings to its right have a **smaller** height.

Return a list of indices **(0-indexed)** of buildings that have an ocean view, sorted in increasing order.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: heights = [4,2,3,1]
Output: [0,2,3]
Explanation: Building 1 (0-indexed) does not have an ocean view because building 2 is taller.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: heights = [4,3,2,1]
Output: [0,1,2,3]
Explanation: All the buildings have an ocean view.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: heights = [1,3,2,4]
Output: [3]
Explanation: Only building 3 has an ocean view.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: heights = [2,2,2,2]
Output: [3]
Explanation: Buildings cannot see the ocean if there are buildings of the same height to its right.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= heights.length <= 105`
* `1 <= heights[i] <= 109`
