# 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists

Description

Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

* If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.
* The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
* You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

Example

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
	A:          a1 → a2
	                   ↘
	                     c1 → c2 → c3
	                   ↗            
	B:     b1 → b2 → b3

Output: c1
Explanation ：begin to intersect at node c1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
Intersected at 6
1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9->10->11->12->13->null
6->7->8->9->10->11->12->13->null
Output: Intersected at 6
Explanation：begin to intersect at node 6.
```

Challenge

Your code should preferably run in O(_n_) time and use only O(_1_) memory.

Based on question, we can **observe** that the two list have different length, however, they will have the same **tail** if they have the intersection. If they dont have intersection, we also can start from the tail of the linked list.

We need to have two pointer, P1 and P2, for each time, we check if p1 and p2 are the same.

Calculate NN; the length of list A.

* Calculate MM; the length of list B.
* Set the start pointer for the _longer_ list.
* Step the pointers through the list together.

```
public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
    int lenA = length(headA), lenB = length(headB);
    // move headA and headB to the same start point
    while (lenA > lenB) {
        headA = headA.next;
        lenA--;
    }
    while (lenA < lenB) {
        headB = headB.next;
        lenB--;
    }
    // find the intersection until end
    while (headA != headB) {
        headA = headA.next;
        headB = headB.next;
    }
    return headA;
}

private int length(ListNode node) {
    int length = 0;
    while (node != null) {
        node = node.next;
        length++;
    }
    return length;
}
```

You can prove that: say A length = a + c, B length = b + c, after switching pointer, pointer A will move another b + c steps, pointer B will move a + c more steps, since a + c + b + c = b + c + a + c, it does not matter what value c is. Pointer A and B must meet after a + c + b (b + c + a) steps. If c == 0, they meet at NULL. Thanks, hpplayer. This solution is very smart.

```
/**
 * Definition for ListNode
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) {
 *         val = x;
 *         next = null;
 *     }
 * }
 */

public class Solution {
    /**
     * @param headA: the first list
     * @param headB: the second list
     * @return: a ListNode
     */
    public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
        if (headA == null || headB == null) return null;
        
        ListNode a = headA;
        ListNode b = headB;
        while (a != b) {
            a = a == null? headB : a.next;
            b = b == null? headA : b.next;    
        }
        return a;
    }
}
```
