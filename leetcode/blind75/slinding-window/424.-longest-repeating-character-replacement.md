# 424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most `k`times.

Return _the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations_.

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
</strong><strong>Output: 4
</strong><strong>Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
</strong><strong>Output: 4
</strong><strong>Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
</strong>The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
There may exists other ways to achive this answer too.
</code></pre>

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 105`
* `s` consists of only uppercase English letters.
* `0 <= k <= s.length`

a typical slidning window issue. The res is the valid window size. So the result was updated after move the left pointer.

```
class Solution {
    public int characterReplacement(String s, int k) {
        int start = 0;
        int[] frequencyMap = new int[26];
        int maxFrequency = 0;
        int longestSubstringLength = 0;

        for (int end = 0; end < s.length(); end += 1) {
            // if 'A' is 0, then what is the relative order
            // or offset of the current character entering the window
            // 0 is 'A', 1 is 'B' and so on
            int currentChar = s.charAt(end) - 'A';

            frequencyMap[currentChar] += 1;

            // the maximum frequency we have seen in any window yet
            maxFrequency = Math.max(maxFrequency, frequencyMap[currentChar]);

            // move the start pointer towards right if the current
            // window is invalid
            Boolean isValid = (end + 1 - start - maxFrequency <= k);
            if (!isValid) {
                // offset of the character moving out of the window
                int outgoingChar = s.charAt(start) - 'A';

                // decrease its frequency
                frequencyMap[outgoingChar] -= 1;

                // move the start pointer forward
                start += 1;
            }

            // the window is valid at this point, note down the length
            // size of the window never decreases
            longestSubstringLength = end + 1 - start;
        }

        return longestSubstringLength;
    }
}
```
