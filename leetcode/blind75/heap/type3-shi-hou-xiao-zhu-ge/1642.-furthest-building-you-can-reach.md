# 1642. Furthest Building You Can Reach

You are given an integer array `heights` representing the heights of buildings, some `bricks`, and some `ladders`.

You start your journey from building `0` and move to the next building by possibly using bricks or ladders.

While moving from building `i` to building `i+1` (**0-indexed**),

* If the current building's height is **greater than or equal** to the next building's height, you do **not**need a ladder or bricks.
* If the current building's height is less than the next building's height, you can either use **one ladder** or `(h[i+1] - h[i])` **bricks**.

_Return the furthest building index (0-indexed) you can reach if you use the given ladders and bricks optimally._

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/27/q4.gif)

<pre><code><strong>Input: heights = [4,2,7,6,9,14,12], bricks = 5, ladders = 1
</strong><strong>Output: 4
</strong><strong>Explanation: Starting at building 0, you can follow these steps:
</strong>- Go to building 1 without using ladders nor bricks since 4 >= 2.
- Go to building 2 using 5 bricks. You must use either bricks or ladders because 2 &#x3C; 7.
- Go to building 3 without using ladders nor bricks since 7 >= 6.
- Go to building 4 using your only ladder. You must use either bricks or ladders because 6 &#x3C; 9.
It is impossible to go beyond building 4 because you do not have any more bricks or ladders.
</code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: heights = [4,12,2,7,3,18,20,3,19], bricks = 10, ladders = 2
</strong><strong>Output: 7
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 3:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: heights = [14,3,19,3], bricks = 17, ladders = 0
</strong><strong>Output: 3
</strong></code></pre>

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= heights.length <= 105`
* `1 <= heights[i] <= 106`
* `0 <= bricks <= 109`
* `0 <= ladders <= heights.length`
