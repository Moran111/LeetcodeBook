# 865. Smallest Subtree with all the Deepest Nodes

Given the `root` of a binary tree, the depth of each node is **the shortest distance to the root**.

Return _the smallest subtree_ such that it contains **all the deepest nodes** in the original tree.

A node is called **the deepest** if it has the largest depth possible among any node in the entire tree.

The **subtree** of a node is a tree consisting of that node, plus the set of all descendants of that node.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]
</strong><strong>Output: [2,7,4]
</strong><strong>Explanation: We return the node with value 2, colored in yellow in the diagram.
</strong>The nodes coloured in blue are the deepest nodes of the tree.
Notice that nodes 5, 3 and 2 contain the deepest nodes in the tree but node 2 is the smallest subtree among them, so we return it.
</code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: root = [1]
</strong><strong>Output: [1]
</strong><strong>Explanation: The root is the deepest node in the tree.
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 3:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: root = [0,1,3,null,2]
</strong><strong>Output: [2]
</strong><strong>Explanation: The deepest node in the tree is 2, the valid subtrees are the subtrees of nodes 2, 1 and 0 but the subtree of node 2 is the smallest.
</strong></code></pre>

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range `[1, 500]`.
* `0 <= Node.val <= 500`
* The values of the nodes in the tree are **unique**.

**Note:** This question is the same as 1123: [https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-deepest-leaves/](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-deepest-leaves/)

&#x20;_smallest subtree_ such that it contains **all the deepest nodes** in the original tree.

We need to know the depth of each node in the tree and the max depth of left, right subtree. The root of its max subtree - curr node.&#x20;
