# 124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

A **path** in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence **at most once**. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The **path sum** of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the maximum **path sum** of any **non-empty** path_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/13/exx1.jpg)

<pre><code><strong>Input: root = [1,2,3]
</strong><strong>Output: 6
</strong><strong>Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/13/exx2.jpg)

<pre><code><strong>Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
</strong><strong>Output: 42
</strong><strong>Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.
</strong></code></pre>

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 3 * 104]`.
* `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

```
    for a node, max path, start with node and go down through its left child.
      start with node and go down through its right child.
      start with node and includes its left child and right child.
      only contains itself.
```

The function returns the path sum gain contributed by the subtree.

The function keeps track of the maximum path sum.

 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
