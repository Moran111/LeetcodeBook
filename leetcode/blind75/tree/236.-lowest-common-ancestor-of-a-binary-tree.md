# 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest\_common\_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
</strong><strong>Output: 3
</strong><strong>Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png)

<pre><code><strong>Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
</strong><strong>Output: 5
</strong><strong>Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 3:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2
</strong><strong>Output: 1
</strong></code></pre>

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 105]`.
* `-109 <= Node.val <= 109`
* All `Node.val` are **unique**.
* `p != q`
* `p` and `q` will exist in the tree.

find left subtree LCA of P,Q, find right subtree LCA of p,q. we don't care if we do find a real p and q in the tree. As long as root.left and root.right is p or q, root is LCA. As long as p,q is child of root, return root.

        as long as p,q is child of root, return root
         */
         if (root == null || root == p || root == q) {
             return root;
         }
         TreeNode left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
         TreeNode right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
         if (left != null && right != null) {
             //left is q or p doesn't matter
             return root;
         }
         if (left != null) {
             // Right doesn't contain p nor q but left contains one of them or both.
             return left; 
         }
         // Left doesn't contain p nor q but right contains one of them or both.
         return right;
    }
}
