# 1325. Delete Leaves With a Given Value

Given a binary tree `root` and an integer `target`, delete all the **leaf nodes** with value `target`.

Note that once you delete a leaf node with value `target`**,** if its parent node becomes a leaf node and has the value `target`, it should also be deleted (you need to continue doing that until you cannot).

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: root = [1,2,3,2,null,2,4], target = 2
</strong><strong>Output: [1,null,3,null,4]
</strong><strong>Explanation: Leaf nodes in green with value (target = 2) are removed (Picture in left). 
</strong>After removing, new nodes become leaf nodes with value (target = 2) (Picture in center).
</code></pre>

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/09/sample\_2\_1684.png)

<pre><code><strong>Input: root = [1,3,3,3,2], target = 3
</strong><strong>Output: [1,3,null,null,2]
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/15/sample\_3\_1684.png)

<pre><code><strong>Input: root = [1,2,null,2,null,2], target = 2
</strong><strong>Output: [1]
</strong><strong>Explanation: Leaf nodes in green with value (target = 2) are removed at each step.
</strong></code></pre>

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 3000]`.
* `1 <= Node.val, target <= 1000`
