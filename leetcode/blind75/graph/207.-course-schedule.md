# 207. Course Schedule

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must** take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

* For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
</strong><strong>Output: true
</strong><strong>Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
</strong>To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
</code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
</strong><strong>Output: false
</strong><strong>Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
</strong>To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
</code></pre>

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
* `0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000`
* `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= ai, bi < numCourses`
* All the pairs prerequisites\[i] are **unique**.

Course has dependency. Using Topological sorting.&#x20;

Having a indegree array/map to represent this dependency. count how many edges point to this vertex. The number of edges represent the dependency. When there is no dependency, 0 indegree, we can take this course. Then, we can try to traverse the graph, if every node in the graph can be reached, that means we can take all course. Otherwise, cannot.

1. build a graph based on the description
2. build a indgree map/array to represent the dependecy of each node
3. when indegree is 0, (no dependency), we can reach this node.
4. after we reached one node, all its neigbour's dependency - 1 (indegree - 1).&#x20;
5. traverse entire graph using this way

```
class Solution {
    public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
        // Topological sort to find the cycle in the graph
        Map<Integer, Integer> indegree = new HashMap<>();
        // node, number of edge point to this node
        Map<Integer, Set<Integer>> graph = new HashMap<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
            indegree.put(i, 0);
        }

        // create the graph from preprequisites
        for (int[] pre: prerequisites) {
            graph.putIfAbsent(pre[0], new HashSet<>());
            graph.putIfAbsent(pre[1], new HashSet<>());
            //  [[1,0]] => 0 -> 1
            graph.get(pre[1]).add(pre[0]);
            indegree.put(pre[0], indegree.getOrDefault(pre[0], 0) + 1);
        }

        // have cycle, traverse the graph, all node indegree should be 0
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int key: indegree.keySet()) {
            if (indegree.get(key) == 0) {
                queue.offer(key);
            }  
        }
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int curr = queue.poll();
            numCourses--;
            if (!graph.containsKey(curr)) {
                continue;
            }
            Set<Integer> neigbhour = graph.get(curr);
            for (int n: neigbhour) {
                indegree.put(n, indegree.get(n) - 1);
                if (indegree.get(n) == 0) {
                    queue.offer(n);
                }
            }
        }
        // num courses == 0, all node in graph we has visited
        return numCourses == 0;
    }
}
```
