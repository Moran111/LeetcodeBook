# 133. Clone Graph

* The number of nodes in the graph is in the range `[0, 100]`.
* `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
* `Node.val` is unique for each node.
* There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
* The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.

**Constraints:**

&#x20;

<pre><code><strong>Input: adjList = []
</strong><strong>Output: []
</strong><strong>Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 3:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: adjList = [[]]
</strong><strong>Output: [[]]
</strong><strong>Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
</strong><strong>Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
</strong><strong>Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
</strong>1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).

**Example 1:**

&#x20;

The given node will always be the first node with `val = 1`. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.

An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with `val == 1`, the second node with `val == 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

**Test case format:**

&#x20;

```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
```

Each node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

Return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object\_copying#Deep\_copy) (clone) of the graph.

Given a reference of a node in a [**connected**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity\_\(graph\_theory\)#Connected\_graph) undirected graph.



When clone graph, we need to copy the node and copy its relationships with its neighbors. How to easily access the neighbor by using the current node? Because we traversal current graph by using current node, we need to easily get the copied node from these current node.&#x20;

* having a Map \<currentNode, CopiedNode>&#x20;

<pre><code><strong>          for (Node n: currNeig) {
</strong>                // if n is created copied, not need to copy it one more time,
                // just reference it
                if (!visited.containsKey(n)) {
                    Node nn = new Node(n.val);
                    visited.put(n, nn);
                    queue.add(n);
                }
                visited.get(curr).neighbors.add(visited.get(n)); 
            } 
</code></pre>

When traversing the graph, we need to avoid traversal duplicate node to avoid cycle.&#x20;

```
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
    public Node() {
        val = 0;
        neighbors = new ArrayList<Node>();
    }
    public Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = new ArrayList<Node>();
    }
    public Node(int _val, ArrayList<Node> _neighbors) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = _neighbors;
    }
}
*/

class Solution {
    public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {
        if (node == null) {
            return null;
        }
        // dfs or bfs graph, avoid traversal duplicate node to avoid cycle
        // can also reference to the new copied node from current node
        Map<Node, Node> visited = new HashMap<>();
        Queue<Node> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.add(node);
        Node nNode = new Node(node.val);
        visited.put(node, nNode);

        while(!queue.isEmpty()) {
            Node curr = queue.poll();
            List<Node> currNeig = curr.neighbors;
            for (Node n: currNeig) {
                // if n is copied, not need to copy it one more time,
                // just reference it
                if (!visited.containsKey(n)) {
                    Node nn = new Node(n.val);
                    visited.put(n, nn);
                    queue.add(n);
                }
                visited.get(curr).neighbors.add(visited.get(n)); 
            }
        }
        return visited.get(node);
    }
}
```
