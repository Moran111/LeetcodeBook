# 271. Encode and Decode Strings

Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a string. The encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original list of strings.

Machine 1 (sender) has the function:

```
string encode(vector<string> strs) {
  // ... your code
  return encoded_string;
}
```

Machine 2 (receiver) has the function:

```
vector<string> decode(string s) {
  //... your code
  return strs;
}
```

So Machine 1 does:

```
string encoded_string = encode(strs);
```

and Machine 2 does:

```
vector<string> strs2 = decode(encoded_string);
```

`strs2` in Machine 2 should be the same as `strs` in Machine 1.

Implement the `encode` and `decode` methods.

You are not allowed to solve the problem using any serialize methods (such as `eval`).

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: dummy_input = ["Hello","World"]
</strong><strong>Output: ["Hello","World"]
</strong><strong>Explanation:
</strong>Machine 1:
Codec encoder = new Codec();
String msg = encoder.encode(strs);
Machine 1 ---msg---> Machine 2

Machine 2:
Codec decoder = new Codec();
String[] strs = decoder.decode(msg);
</code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: dummy_input = [""]
</strong><strong>Output: [""]
</strong></code></pre>

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= strs.length <= 200`
* `0 <= strs[i].length <= 200`
* `strs[i]` contains any possible characters out of `256` valid ASCII characters.

&#x20;

**Follow up:** Could you write a generalized algorithm to work on any possible set of characters?



when encode and decode string, we can have some delimeter to seperate them. But when the word itself contains delimeter, it will influence our decode result. To avoid this, we can do it by word length + delimeter + word.&#x20;

When decode, we first read until we have delimeter to understand how long of the word. Then we read a single delimeter. After this single delimeter, we start to read excatly length of encode string.&#x20;

```
["Hello", "W12orld", "#Nice"]

encode: 5#Hello7#W12orld5##Nice
when we decode it, before first #, it is the length of word. that means after a 
signle # (delimeter), these length of word is the word we want. 
5#Hello
word length = 5 
read 5 chars after first #. 

Event though word has char same with delimeter, that doesn't matter.
5##Nice
word length = 5
single delemeter = #
read 5 chars after single delemeter: #Nice
```

```
public class Codec {

    // Encodes a list of strings to a single string.
    public String encode(List<String> strs) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

        for (String str: strs) {
            sb.append(str.length());
            sb.append("#");
            sb.append(str);
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }

    // Decodes a single string to a list of strings.
    public List<String> decode(String s) {
        List<String> res = new ArrayList<>();
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

        int i = 0;
        while (i < s.length()) {
            char c = s.charAt(i);
            if (c == '#') {
                // word length
                int len = Integer.parseInt(sb.toString());
                sb = new StringBuilder();
                res.add(s.substring(i+1, i+len + 1));
                i = i + len + 1;
            } else {
                sb.append(s.charAt(i));
                i++;
            }   
        }
        return res;
    }

    /**
    Chunked Transfer Encoding: used for data communication protocals, each of which is accompanied by its length or size.
    we can encode in a way: 
    number of characters in a word + word, in that way, we can read characters after this number
    -> issue is: what if word contains a integer
    Then we need a delimeter, 
    number of characters + delimters + word, string will always start with integers, the integer going to represent the following word.
    read character before delimeter (it is a length of following word)
    count next length of characters after the delimeter
    -> it works, even though the word itself contains delimeter
     */
