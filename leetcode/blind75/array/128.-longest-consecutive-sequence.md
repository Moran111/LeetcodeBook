# 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return _the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence._

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
</strong><strong>Output: 4
</strong><strong>Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
</strong><strong>Output: 9
</strong></code></pre>

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= nums.length <= 105`
* `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`

```
observe:
100
200
1 2 3 4

we have 3 groups of numbers. The last group has the largest longest consecuritve 
sequence.
```

If we can find these groups, then we can know the largest sequence. But how each group starts? When a group starts, its num - 1 doesn't exist in the array. -> if num - 1 doesn't exist in the array, that means it is the smallest number in a sequence and it is a start of a sequence.

After we identify the start of the sequence, we can check if num + 1 exist in the array and count how many numbers exist in one group sequence. (from the start, find all its consecutive sequence)

For quickly check if a number exist -> HashSet

```
class Solution {
    public int longestConsecutive(int[] nums) {
       // solution1: sort the array (nlogn)
       /**
       how to identify the start of each consecutive sequence
       left number didn't have the left number
        */
    
        int maxLen = 0;
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int num: nums) {
            set.add(num);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            // identify the start of the sequence
            if (!set.contains(nums[i] - 1)) {
                // find all its consecutive sequence
                int currNum = nums[i];
                int currLen = 1;
                while (set.contains(currNum + 1)) {
                    currLen = currLen + 1;
                    currNum = currNum + 1;
                }
                maxLen = Math.max(currLen, maxLen);
            } else {
                // it is not the start of the sequence
            }
        }
        return maxLen;
    }
}
```
