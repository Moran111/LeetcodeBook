# 11. Container With Most Water

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return _the maximum amount of water a container can store_.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
</strong><strong>Output: 49
</strong><strong>Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: height = [1,1]
</strong><strong>Output: 1
</strong></code></pre>

**Constraints:**

* `n == height.length`
* `2 <= n <= 105`
* `0 <= height[i] <= 104`

`Brute force: find all possible containers, compare them`

the hight is width \* min(left height, right height) we want to max our width and try each combination of height to max our width: we can have a left, right pointer point to the left & right of the array left = 0, right = 8 -> max area = 8-0 \* 1 = 8 Right is pretty hight compare than left, left is bottle neck, try move another left left = 1, right = 8 -> max area = 8-1 \* (8,7) = 49

```
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        // how many water can be trapped depends on 
        // highest bar in the left and current bar from left side
        // width * height
        /**
         the hight is width * min(left height, right height)
         we want to max our width and try each combination of height
         to max our width: we can have a left, right pointer point to the left & right of the array
         left = 0, right = 8 -> max area = 8-0 * 1 = 8
         Right is pretty hight compare than left, left is bottle neck, try move another left
         left = 1, right = 8 -> max area = 8-1 * (8,7) = 49 
         */

        int left = 0; int right = height.length - 1;
        int max = 0;
        while (left < right) {
            int area = (right - left) * Math.min(height[left], height[right]);
            max = Math.max(max, area);
            if (height[left] <= height[right]) {
                left++;
            } else if (height[right] < height[left]) {
                right--;
            }
        }
        return max;
