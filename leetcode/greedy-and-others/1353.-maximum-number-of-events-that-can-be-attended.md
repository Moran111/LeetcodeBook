# 1353. Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended

Given an array of `events` where `events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi]`. Every event `i` starts at `startDayi` and ends at `endDayi`.

You can attend an event `i` at any day `d` where `startTimei <= d <= endTimei`. Notice that you can only attend one event at any time `d`.

Return _the maximum number of events _you can attend.

**Example 1:**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/05/e1.png)

```
Input: events = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
Output: 3
Explanation: You can attend all the three events.
One way to attend them all is as shown.
Attend the first event on day 1.
Attend the second event on day 2.
Attend the third event on day 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: events= [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,2]]
Output: 4
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: events = [[1,4],[4,4],[2,2],[3,4],[1,1]]
Output: 4
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: events = [[1,100000]]
Output: 1
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: events = [[1,1],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[1,6],[1,7]]
Output: 7
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= events.length <= 105`
* `events[i].length == 2`
* `1 <= startDayi <= endDayi <= 105`

如果我今天一定要参加一个event的话，那么参加今天open但是结束的最早的这个event

```
class Solution {
    public int maxEvents(int[][] events) {
        // current open event, sort by endday
        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> a[1] - b[1]); 
        
        // sort by start day
        Arrays.sort(events, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
        
        int res = 0;
        int i = 0;
        for (int d = 1; d <= 100000; d++) {
            // add events attendable into queue
            while (i < events.length && events[i][0] == d) {
                pq.offer(events[i]);
                i++;
            }
            // remvoe the events that already closed
            while (!pq.isEmpty() && pq.peek()[1] < d) {
                pq.poll();
            }
            // todays open events, attend todays events which will finish earlest
            if (!pq.isEmpty()) {
                pq.poll();
                res++;
            }
        }
        
        return res;
    }
}

// [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,2]]
// day1 day2 day3 day4
// [1      ]
//      [      3]
//           [       4]
// [       2]    


// for each day, we attend the events ends earliest
// how to keep track which events end ealiest - pq sort by end time
// what is the attentable event for dayT. startTime <= t <= endTime
// attend earler event first
```
