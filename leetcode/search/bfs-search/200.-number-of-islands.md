# 200. Number of Islands



Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return _the number of islands_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:**

* `m == grid.length`
* `n == grid[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 300`
* `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.



class Solution { public int numIslands(char\[]\[] grid) {

```
    int res = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] == '1') {
                bfs(grid, i, j);
                res++;
            }
        }
    }
    return res;
}

private void bfs(char[][] grid, int r, int c) {
    int[] dx = new int[]{0,0,-1,1};
    int[] dy = new int[]{1,-1,0,0};

    Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    queue.offer(new int[]{r,c});
    grid[r][c] = '0';

    while(queue.size() > 0) {
        int[] curr = queue.poll();
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            // if next surrounding is out of index
            int nr = curr[0] + dx[i];
            int nc = curr[1] + dy[i];
            if (nr < 0 || nc < 0 || nr >= grid.length || nc >= grid[0].length) {
                continue;
            }
            // if it is visited, then skip
            if (grid[nr][nc] == '0') {
                continue;
            }
            queue.offer(new int[]{nr, nc});
            grid[nr][nc] = '0';
        }
    }
}
